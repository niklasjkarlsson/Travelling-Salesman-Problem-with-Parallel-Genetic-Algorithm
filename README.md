# Travelling Salesman With Parallel Genetic Algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a C++ implementation of a parallel genetic algorithm to solve the 
travelling salesman problem using MPI. The algorithm takes in a list of cities 
and finds shortest routes to travel through every city returning to the starting 
point at the end. 

The source code is found in the src directory, while input and output files are 
in the run directory.

More information on the algorithm as well as on the performance of the 
implementation is found in the report.
